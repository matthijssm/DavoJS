# DavoJS
A library for parsing, editing and converting digital music sheets. Supported formats: ChordPro, Chord Sheet.

DavoJS is used for Davo Pro. DavoJS provides an API for reading and modifing digital music sheets.

# How it works
DavoJS parses ChordPro and Chord sheets to a generic `SheetModel`. In this format it is easy to modify songs in a Javascript way. A `SheetModel` can then be exported to JSON or ChordPro.
